For well-structured pseudocode, follow these additional principles:
- Maintain a one-to-one correspondence between lines and actions;
- Use consistent capitalization for keywords;
- Concentrate on outlining the logical flow rather than specific syntax;
- Meticulously include all necessary steps to prevent omissions in your program's design
