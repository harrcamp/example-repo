scenario 1: an algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value,
then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were entered.

    prompt user to enter a number
        check if the number is less than 0,
        if yes then return an error and request another number
    store the number in a list
    when 0 is entered sort the list in descending order
        print first number in the list
        print list

scenario 2: an algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then stores their name in a variable called 
first_name. Subsequently, the algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase "Hello, World".

    prompt user to enter their first name
        check the input for numbers
        return error and request name again until only letters are entered
    assign input to variable first_name
    print first_name combined with "Hello, World" in one line

scenario 3: an algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average

    input integers and store in a list
    count numbers in the list
        store value as variable number_of_integers
    calculate the sum of the numbers in the list
        store value as variable sum_of_integers
    divide variable sum_of_integers by number_of_integers
    print result

scenario 4: an algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that
are still left to buy

    prompt user to enter text values for grocery list items and 
        store values in a list
        check for duplicates and remove from list
        sort list in alphabetical order
    repeat until user enters "List Complete" 

    prompt user to enter text values in the list
        Check for item in the list
            return error if entered value is not in list
            remove value if item is in list 
        sort list in alphabetical order 
        print list 
    repeat until list is empty then print "You're done shopping!"

    scenario 5: an algorithm for the flow chart on the following page:  

        read first input and store as variable X
            print variable X
        read second input and store as variable Y
            print variable Y
        calculate sum X and Y 
            store sum as variable S
        calculate variable S divided by 2
            store calculation as vairable A
        calculate X multiplied by Y
            store calculation as variabl P
        print variables S, A, P
